# nasa_api_photo_of_the_day
Uses the NASA Photo of the Day API to display photos and videos of the day dating back to the mid-1990's. Has ability to display todays photo as well as any custom date.

This project displays my competence working with external API's as well as JSON data - and rendering that data into client side experiences.
